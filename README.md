# Automated 10K Web Scraper

This project utilizes tools such as Selenium to create an automated web scraper that fetches the latest filed 10K report of any registered company with the US SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). The content of the report is then parsed and sectioned using regular expressions (REGEX).
